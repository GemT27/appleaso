In the latest Apple Store algorithm, Apple gives a bigger weight to social factors in app ranking rules. Moreover, a report shows that reviews are the most significant factors when users search on app store. This means that if you get more positive reviews , the ranking of your app will greatly be improved. The most popular app is the most reviewed app. That is why app reviews become more and more important.
